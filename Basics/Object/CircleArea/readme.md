## Question
Write a program that computes the area of a circular region (the shaded area in  
the diagram), given the **radius** of the **inner** and the **outer** circles, respectively **ri** and **ro**,  
respectively. We compute the area of the circular region by subtracting the area  
of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle. Define a **Circle** class that has  
method **(printArea())** to compute the area and print the area. You set the circles’  
radius with the **setRadius** method or via a **constructor**. You have to also create an  
object of **Circle** class from the **main** method. Take the values of **ri** and **ro** from the  
users. Set the circles’ radius with the **setRadius** method or via a **constructor**. Call  
**printArea()** to show the output.
