## Question
Write a **Triangle** class that has three instance variables **a, b and c.** There are also  
two methods **printPerimeter** and **printArea** to compute the perimeter and the area  
of the triangle and print the perimeter and area. You can set the instance variables  
of each triangle’s object, a, b and c with the **setInfo** method or via a **constructor**.  
In addition, it will check if the input from the user is valid or not. If the input is valid,  
it will print **perimeter** and the **area** of each triangle object. You have to also create  
an **object** of **Triangle** class from the **main** method. Take the values of **a, b and c**  
from the **user**(s). Set the **Triangle**’s a, b and c with the **setInfo** method or via a  
**constructor**. Call **printPerimeter** and **printArea** to show the output.
