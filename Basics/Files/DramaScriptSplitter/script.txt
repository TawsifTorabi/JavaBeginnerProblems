April: So now I'm crazy because I don't love you, right? Is that the point?
Frank: No! Wrong! You're not crazy, and you do love me. That's the point, April.
April: But I don't. I hate you. You were just some boy who made me laugh at a party once, and now I loathe the sight of you. In fact, if you come any closer, if you touch me or anything, I think I'll scream.
Frank: Oh, come on, stop this April.
April: What are you going to do now? Are you going to hit me? To show me how much you love me?
Frank: Don't worry, I can't be bothered
